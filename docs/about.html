                The name Phased Star has no real meaning, I belive it was the coolest username I could think of when making my Instagram account. My art has been described as "Harry Who meeting Mexican realism". This definitly came as a shock to myself, considering my art career began with tracing manga art. 
                As of reacently, my focus has been towards, my major, graphic design and bold digital pieces.

                 The process for my pieces typically
                begins with a sketch so vauge, 
                only I can really tell what it is. 
                From there I do many concept sketches 
                until I get every detail mapped out for 
                the final product. Consider checking out one of my socials to see more of my progress on! You can also email me any questions with the flashing 
                link to the left.
